# Programming-Tryout
I would like to be a part of 4930’s programming sub-team for a multitude of reasons. First, robotics and writing code, individually, have always been of great interest to me; together, they are even more fascinating. Although I’ve only experienced one year on the programming sub-team, I’ve gained a great amount of experience in Java programming as it pertains to robotics. There is a great amount of pride felt when your robot succeeds in a competition. You realize that without your code and the effort that you put in, the robot wouldn’t be anything more than scrap parts. Another reason I’d like to be on the sub-team is that a lot of my friends are fellow programmers. It’d be fun to problem solve and hang out together at meetings. I’ve learned a great deal about Java in my computer science class in school and I would love to add to my knowledge through robotics. Last year, I felt like we spent a lot of time exclusively learning about how Java pertains to robotics. I think it would be a great idea to learn more about robots and the technology associated with them. I hope I’ll be a welcome addition to the sub-team and have a great season!
